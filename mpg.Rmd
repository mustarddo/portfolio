# üöò Intro

Greetings everyone, I welcome you to dive in analysis on fuel consumption dataset, 'mpg', 

Library we're using have tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, ggthemes, patchwork

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(patchwork)
```

## üöò Preview data 

```{r}
str(mpg)
glimpse(mpg)
```

Let's take a look on some interesting variables in dataset, manufacturer, model, displ, cty and class.
I also noticed that year values seem suspicious. then i'll check it.
```{r}
unique(mpg$year)
```
Result show us 'year' column have only 2 values, '1999' and '2008'. That is seem to be unuseful. So i'll leave it be

### Check null value
next step we have to check if their any null value in mpg dataset.

```{r}
sum(is.na(mpg))
```
Okay, that's nice. The result seems to be no any null value in mpg.
Let's start asking some question in our dataset and visualize it.


## üöò 1. Number of cars by manufacturer
### How many cars came from this manufacturer?

Let's easily check number of cars in each manufacturer
```{r}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(manufacturer , -count), y = count, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = reorder(manufacturer , -count), y = count, label = count )) + 
  labs(title = "Number of cars by manufacturer", x = "manufacturer", y = "cars_count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

Wow!. Dodge, Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford are the big-4 in Car market. because they have lots of car models. Let's dive further.


## üöò 2. Car Classes ratio across all manufacturer
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = manufacturer, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(title = "Car Classes ratio across all manufacturer") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

This visualization show us that each manufacturer how are they focus on each car class. Mercury, Lincoln, Land Rover, jeep are focus only SUV. While Volkswagen, Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet, 'The big-4 in car market', have 3 or more than of car class in their car model. 

## üöò 3. Comparing between average city & highway m/gal across manufacturer
```{r, out.width="80%"}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty),
            mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = reorder(manufacturer, -mean_hwy),
                     y= mean_hwy ,
                     ymin = mean_cty,
                     ymax = mean_hwy))+
  geom_point(aes(x= manufacturer, y = mean_hwy),
             color = "seagreen", size = 5, shape = 8)+
  geom_point(aes(x= manufacturer, y = mean_cty),
            fill = "darkgoldenrod" , size = 5, shape = 22) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Comparing between average city m/gal & average highway m/gal across car manufacturer",
       y = "m/gal", x = "model", caption = "‚ú± : highway m/gal , ‚ñÆ : city m/gal")

```
The visualization surpised us that 'Honda' come to be #1 on the best fuel effiency manufacturer.
Next we will look more deeper into car model.


## üöò 4. Top 10 Car Models with the Best City and Highway Fuel Efficiency

```{r,out.width="120%"}
mpg %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  arrange(desc(cty)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  mutate(model_name = paste(manufacturer, model, displ, "(",year,")", trans)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_linerange(aes(x = reorder(model_name, -cty),
                     y= hwy ,
                     ymin = cty,
                     ymax = hwy))+
  geom_point(aes(x= model_name, y = hwy),
             color = "seagreen", size = 5, shape = 8)+
  geom_point(aes(x= model_name, y = cty),
            fill = "darkgoldenrod" , size = 5, shape = 22, ) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 car models with the best city and highway fuel efficiency",
       x = "model",
       y = "m/gal") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

Even Volkswagen isn't the best fuel efficiency on overall consumption. But top 3 of the most fuel efficiency car are all 'Volkswagen' came along with Toyota and Honda.
  

## üöò 5. Comparing city fuel consumption between car classes and their engine displacement

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class), size = 2.8) +
  labs(title = "Comparing city fuel consumption between car classes and their engine displacement") +
  facet_wrap(~class, 2)

```
We can examine the graph to identify which class has a higher dot, indicating lower fuel consumption. This suggests that compact and subcompact cars stand out as classes with good fuel efficiency.

## üöò 6. Comparing Engine Displacement fuel consumption between city and highway paths

```{r}
cty_displ <- mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "slateblue") +
  labs(title = "Comparing Engine Displacement fuel consumption between city and highway paths",
       y = "city m/gal") +
  theme_minimal()

hwy_displ <- mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "seagreen" )+
  labs(y = "highway m/gal") +
  theme_minimal()

cty_displ / hwy_displ + plot_layout(axis_titles = "collect")
```

Let's delve into some details about car engine displacement. The trend lines from both graphs reveal that a lower engine displacement indicates that the car will have lower fuel consumption.

## üîë Key Takeaways
### 1. Compact and Subcompact cars can rely on good fuel efficiency.
### 2. Lower engine displacement indicates that the car will have lower fuel consumption.
